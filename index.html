              <br>
              <p class="tab">
                Based on the assumption and analysis of the migration process of AMH (Anatomically Modern Humans) from
                African origins,
                more remote areas from Africa are generally assumed to have younger and sparser archaeological sites.
                When studying the
                origins, these areas are often undervalued, as the rock art of Southeast Asia has always been less
                thoroughly studied
                than that of Europe. However, in 2014, new dating evidence from Sulawesi Island in Indonesia
                demonstrated that the
                earliest cave paintings of AMH in Southeast Asia are of the late Pleistocene age and as early as those
                of Europe
                (Aubert, et al., 2014). The similar form of motifs painted in caves in both areas demonstrates a shared
                underlying
                stimulation that led to this behavioral modernity and variability (Taçon, et al., 2014).

              <p class="tab">
                The cave paintings of The Maros karst on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, were discovered as early as the
                1950s and since
                then believed to be less than 10 kyr in age (Roebroeks, 2014). However, in 2014, Aubert’s team dated
                some of the
                paintings and unexpectedly found them to be one of the oldest cave paintings in the world. This
                spectacular finding
                implies that engraving images on cave walls were already a prevalent activity as early as 40,000 years
                ago in Southeast
                Asia at the other end of the Pleistocene Eurasian continent.

              <h3>Methodology - How do scientists date cave paintings?</h3>
              <p>Mineral-rich water trickling over cave walls can form thin layers of calcite called speleothem, which
                contains uranium.
                The radioactive decay of uranium makes the dating of the cave walls possible. This is called the
                uranium–thorium dating
                method.</p>

              <p>Scientists measure the activity ratios of parent (Uranium) and product (Thorium) isotopes by
                calculating the
                disintegration of the parent to the daughter over time. The U-Th dating method can be used for samples
                dated between
                present and over 500 kyr, which represents a much longer timespan than 14C dating (~40 kyr).</p>

              <h2>Discovery</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Aubert’s team found several unexpected results in the Karst Maros. One stenciled hand was painted at
                least 39 kyr BP (See Fig. 4.) and
                images of a babirusa (pig deer) and a large pig-like mysterious animal were painted at least 35 kyr BP
                (See Fig. 6., Aubert, et al.,
                2014). It is comparable in date with a red disk from El Castillo, the oldest cave painting known so far,
                in northern
                Spain with a minimum age of 40 kyr (Pike, et al., 2012).

              <p>
                Now Aubert’s team has proved cave paintings appeared in Europe and in southeast Asia at about the same
                time around 40
                kyr BP. This is an important observation, but the contemporaneity of cave paintings in both areas was
                not likely a
                result of the southern dispersal and the coastal migration because of the great distance of the length
                of Eurasia
                continent. Archaeologists have not even decided on what factors stimulated these AMH to create these
                cave paintings.

                But have we ever considered that those handprints were most likely incidental to ordinary or chaotic
                activities, like
                the marks left by daily hunting or tribal bloodshed when dragging bodies (Medina-Alcaide et al., 2017),
                and were later
                associated meaningfully with ochre? And some ethnologists’s studies suggests that these red marks may be
                a surplus of a
                red paste they mixed with ochre powder and herbs to protect them from injury (Medina-Alcaide et al.,
                2017).

              <h2>Figurative paintings</h2>

              <br />
              <p>
                Whether the creation of handmarks is unintentional remains to be argued, but the creation of figurative
                paintings is
                undoubtedly intentional. One of the distinguishing traits separating the Upper Paleolithic from the
                Middle Paleolithic
                is the appearance of figurative art, which has been seen as symbolizing the emergence of full behavioral
                modernity
                (Yosef, 2002) And what's intriguing is that in all the Paleolithic archaeological research so far, the
                fact that human
                images in cave paintings were exceptional. Instead, animals were typically painted, including those that
                were used as
                food as well as those that symbolized strength (Auber, 2019).

              <br>
              <p>The creation of figurative painting shows an epoch-making point of behavioral modernity, representing
                the emergence of
                early human behavior with the ability to use complex abstract thinking and display creativity, while the
                variability of
                behavior means that the early human behavior itself is endowed with meaning on the basis of modernity
                (Yosef, 2002).
                Both may be attributed to an important genetic mutation or biological reforming of the brain. And
                possible explanations
                for the cause of these two mechanisms above will be explored around two main points: the role of the
                natural feature and
                the cave itself.</p>
              <p>The first cause is the natural feature. Although itself alone is unlikely to result in the ability to
                produce
                intentional animal descriptions. As one of the natural features most capable of evoking the dynamic
                vision of our
                ancestors as hunters, animals are essential to the evolutionary survival of members of AMH (Hodgson,
                2003). Some defined
                areas of the visual brain have been dedicated to detecting and encoding animal contours receiving strong
                stimulation,
                leading to human's high sensitivity to the perception of contours. This encourages the formation of
                figurative art in
                AMH’s brain, and further reflects in the painting art for convenient memory (Hodgson & Pettitt, 2018).
              </p>
              <p>The second cause is the cave itself. As a result of its dim environment, it can be difficult to tell
                artistic figures
                apart from their natural surroundings. In this way, the cave will mimic the difficulties that hunters
                frequently
                encounter when pursuing animals while keeping an eye out for potential predators (Edensor 2013; Galinier
                et al. 2010).
                Since vision is the most important sense in the brain coding function, when this sense is blocked,
                imagination steps in
                and other senses, such as touch, also come into play. This process may stimulate and develop previously
                untapped brain
                modules.</p>

              <h2>Conclusions</h2>
              <br />
              <p>
                In recent years, more accurate and precise dating methods have been invented and applied to archaeology
                research. Our
                understanding of Palaeolithic cave art in the timing and nature of its origins was placed on a firmer
                foundation. Cave
                art currently constitutes the earliest known example of art in the world, and the presence of animal
                depictions is
                proved to be a similar theme across space.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, the depiction of animals by early humans also validates the possibility of animal
                murals helping and
                strengthening the cognition of early humans' senses and self-awareness, thus gradually adding the
                meaning of their own
                existence to the figurative art, such as the controversial point of the handprint in this paper. But it
                is worth noting
                that hand stencils have a more limited distribution than naturalistic animal paintings (Tacon, et al.,
                2014), which
                means that there may not be a direct correlation between the time and cause of their appearance on the
                same fresco.
                Perhaps the earliest handprints and figurative art still need to be discussed respectively, and more
                subsequent
                discoveries and studies are needed as evidence and authentication.
